Developed a Credit Risk Prediction System that evaluates the probability of loan default based on an applicant's financial profile, credit behavior, and loan details. This model enables financial institutions to make smart, data-driven lending decisions.

📊 Input Features Used:

Age

Income

Loan Amount

Loan Tenure (months)

Loan to Income Ratio

Average Days Past Due (DPD)

Delinquency Ratio

Credit Utilization Ratio

Number of Open Loan Accounts

Residence Type

Loan Purpose

Loan Type

📈 Model Output:

Default Probability

Credit Score

Risk Rating (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)

💡 Problem Statement:

 Traditional credit scoring systems often overlook nuanced borrower behavior and non-linear relationships between features. The goal was to build a modern ML-based scoring model that intelligently assesses borrower risk with transparency and precision.

📌 Model Highlights:

✅ Built a binary classification model to predict loan default probability

✅ Developed a credit score generator scaled between 300 and 900

✅ Introduced a rating system based on credit score thresholds

✅ Feature engineering for key risk indicators like LTI, CUR, and DPD

🎯 Model Performance:

✅ Accuracy: 99%

✅ Recall: 97%

✅ ROC-AUC Score: 0.98

➡️ These results show that the model performs exceptionally well in identifying risky customers while minimizing false negatives — crucial for financial applications.

🔍 Techniques Applied:

 ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 ✅ Feature Engineering & Scaling

 ✅ Logistic Regression & Random Forest comparison

 ✅ Probability Calibration

 ✅ Custom Score Mapping

 ✅ Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

🛠️ Tech Stack:

 Python | pandas | NumPy | scikit-learn | seaborn | matplotlib

🌐 Use Case Impact:

 Designed for financial institutions, NBFCs, and fintech platforms, this app helps automate and enhance loan approval processes — reducing default risk and increasing transparency in credit underwriting.
